------------------------

Introduction to programmers on concepts of machine learning and how they can use it on day to day programming tasks to build smarter program.


This is the repo for the talk in gave at Kochi Python on 'Writing Smart Programs'. 


```shopping.py``` - has necessary code to operate on the shopping dataset reciding in the ``shopping``` folder. Uses KNeighborsClassifier and RandomForestClassifier

```svm.py``` - basic demo of creating a SVR ( Support Vector Regression) with scikit-learn for predicting a randomized sine wave.

Install all requirements mentioned in ```requirements.txt``` to run the code (pip install -r requirements).
